We have built a series of web scrapers using B4s, Selenium and Scrapy tailored for market research in South Asian (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Urdu), South East Asia (Thai, Burmese, Bahasa, Viet, Tagalog) and North East Asian languages (Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Korean). 
Contact us for a customised web scraper well below market price.
If your usage is non commercial, feel free to reach out as well, we could send you a Selenium or Scrapy sample tailored for one language.
